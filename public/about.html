<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey! I’m a second-year Data Science student at the University of Utah who loves 
  solving problems, learning new things, and building with code. I enjoy digging 
  through data to find patterns, answer questions, and make sense of the messy 
  stuff. I’ve worked with Python, Java, C++, and R, and I’m always excited to learn 
  more. Whether it's cleaning datasets or building side projects, I enjoy the 
  process of figuring things out. I'm especially interested in how data can drive 
  real-world impact in areas like healthcare and finance. I’m always down to talk 
  data, tech, or cool ideas so, let's connect!
